sigmoid function/logistic function

decision boundary

the reason why not use sqr error for logistic cost functoin is that J(theta) will be non-convex if do so


optinization algorithms
-----------------------
conjugate gradient
BFGS
L-BFG

no need manually choose alpha, using a inner loop line search algorithm to pick an alpha automatically for each iteration, so itconverges faster than gradient descent



one-vs-all(rest) algorithm
