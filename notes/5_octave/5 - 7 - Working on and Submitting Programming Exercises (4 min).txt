In this video, I want to
just quickly step you through the
logistics of how to
work and who work on files and
use the submission system which
will let you right away that
you got the right answer for
your machine learning program exercise.
Here's my Octave window, and let's first go to my desktop.
I saved the files for
my first exercise, some
of the files on my desktop.
This directory, mlclassex1 and
we provide a number
files and ask you to edit some of them. So
the first file should meet
the detail, pdf file for
this permanent exercise to get the details.
But one of the files we also
edit is this file called
warm-up exercise, where you
know the exercise is really just
to make sure that you're familiar with the submission system.
And all you need to do is
return the 5 by 5 identity matrix.
So, you know, the solution to
this exercise as I just to show
you is the right a equals i5 right.
So that modifies this
function to generate the 5 by 5 identity matrix.
And this function warm-up exercise now
returns, you know, the 5 by 5 identity matrix.
And I'm just going to save it.
So I've done the first part of this homework.
Going back to my octave window.
Let's now go to my
directory, Users\ang\Desktop\ml-class-ex1.
And if I want to make
sure that I've, you know, implemented this
in some type warm-up exercise like so.
And yup, it returns that's
the 5 by 5 identity matrix that
we just wrote the code to
create and I can
now submit the code as follows.
I'm going to type submit in
this directory and I'm ready
to submit part one so to enter, you know, choice one.
So last we find email address.
I'm going across the
cross website and, you know,
just list my, this is an external testing site.
So your version of the website may look a little bit different.
But that's my email address
and this is my submission password,
and I'm just going to type them in here.
So I have ang@cs.stanford.edu and my
submission password is 9yC75USsGf.

I'm going to hit
enter, it connects to the server,
and submits it, and by
the way it tells you, you know, it
says congratulations, you have successfully completed homework part one.
And this gives you a
verification that you got this part right.
And if you don't submit the right
answer, then, you know, it will
give you a message indicating that you haven't quite gotten it right.
And by the way you can
use this submission
password and generate a new password.
It doesn't matter.
But you can also use your
regular website login password, but
because, you know, this password here
is typed in clear
text on your monitor we
gave you this extra submission password
in case you don't want to
type in your website's normal
password onto a window that,
depending on your operating system,
this password may or may
not appear as text when
you type it into the Octave
submission script.
So, that's how you submit the homeworks after you've done it.
Good luck, and I hope you
get, when you get around
to homeworks, I hope you get all of them right.
And finally, in the next
and final Octave tutorial video,
I want to tell you
about vectorization, which is a
way to get your Octave code to run much more efficiently.
