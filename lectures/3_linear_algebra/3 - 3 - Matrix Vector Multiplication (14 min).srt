1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,020
In this video, I'd like

2
00:00:01,036 --> 00:00:02,052
to start talking about how to

3
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:04,004
multiply together two matrices.

4
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:06,028
We'll start with a special case

5
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:07,087
of that, of matrix vector

6
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:11,059
multiplication -  multiplying a matrix together with a vector.

7
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:13,039
Let's start with an example.

8
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:15,025
Here is a matrix,

9
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,096
and here is a vector, and

10
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,012
let's say we want to

11
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,025
multiply together this matrix

12
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:23,071
with this vector, what's the result?

13
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:25,003
Let me just work through this

14
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,075
example and then we

15
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:29,003
can step back and look at just what the steps were.

16
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,094
It turns out the result of

17
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,061
this multiplication process is going

18
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:34,020
to be, itself, a vector.

19
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:35,070
And I'm just going work

20
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:37,000
with this first and later we'll

21
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:39,004
come back and see just what I did here.

22
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:41,011
To get the first element of

23
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:42,022
this vector I am going

24
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,084
to take these two numbers

25
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,042
and multiply them with

26
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:49,034
the first row of the

27
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:51,032
matrix and add up the corresponding numbers.

28
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:53,089
Take one multiplied by

29
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:57,003
one, and take

30
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,036
three and multiply it by

31
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,028
five, and that's

32
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:04,007
what, that's one plus fifteen so that gives me sixteen.

33
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,051
I'm going to write sixteen here.

34
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:09,068
then for the second row,

35
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,073
second element, I am

36
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:13,073
going to take the second row

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,006
and multiply it by this vector,

38
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:16,070
so I have four

39
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,000
times one, plus zero

40
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:21,073
times five, which is

41
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:24,020
equal to four, so you'll have four there.

42
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:27,085
And finally for the last

43
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:29,043
one I have two one times

44
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,034
one five, so two

45
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,035
by one, plus one

46
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:35,073
by 5, which is equal

47
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:37,053
to a 7, and

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,073
so I get a 7 over there.

49
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,031
It turns out that the

50
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:47,084
results of multiplying that's

51
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,075
a 3x2 matrix by a

52
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:52,079
2x1 matrix is also

53
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:54,034
just a two-dimensional vector.

54
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,068
The result of this is

55
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,056
going to be a 3x1

56
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:03,035
matrix, so that's why

57
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,045
three by one 3x1

58
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,018
matrix, in other words

59
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:11,050
a 3x1 matrix is just a three dimensional vector.

60
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,018
So I realize that I

61
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:15,058
did that pretty quickly, and you're

62
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:16,077
probably not sure that you can

63
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,033
repeat this process yourself, but

64
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:19,055
let's look in more detail

65
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:21,005
at what just happened and what

66
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:24,090
this process of multiplying a matrix by a vector looks like.

67
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:27,093
Here's the details of how to

68
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:30,024
multiply a matrix by a vector.

69
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:31,065
Let's say I have a matrix A

70
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:32,096
and want to multiply it by

71
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:35,036
a vector x. The

72
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:37,002
result is going to be some

73
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,040
vector y. So the

74
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:40,097
matrix A is a m

75
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,087
by n dimensional matrix, so

76
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:44,080
m rows and n columns and

77
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:46,016
we are going to multiply that by a

78
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:49,021
n by 1 matrix, in other words an n dimensional vector.

79
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:51,008
It turns out this

80
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:54,034
"n" here has to match this "n" here.

81
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:55,081
In other words, the number of

82
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,036
columns in this matrix, so

83
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:00,040
it's the number of n columns.

84
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,018
The number of columns here has

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,097
to match the number of rows here.

86
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:07,091
It has to match the dimension of this vector.

87
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:10,006
And the result of this product

88
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:14,005
is going to be an n-dimensional

89
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:19,034
vector y.  Rows here.

90
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:22,084
"M" is going

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,050
to be equal to the number

92
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:26,056
of rows in this matrix "A".

93
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,062
So how do you actually compute this vector "Y"?

94
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:31,090
Well it turns out to compute

95
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,068
this vector "Y", the process

96
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,086
is to get "Y""I", multiply "A's"

97
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,043
"I'th" row with the

98
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:39,071
elements of the vector "X"

99
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,050
and add them up.

100
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:42,011
So here's what I mean.

101
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:44,025
In order to get the

102
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,050
first element of "Y",

103
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,058
that first number--whatever that turns

104
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,027
out to be--we're gonna take

105
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,094
the first row of the

106
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:54,084
matrix "A" and multiply

107
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,047
them one at a time

108
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:59,015
with the elements of this vector "X".

109
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:01,016
So I take this first number

110
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,084
multiply it by this first number.

111
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:06,090
Then take the second number multiply it by this second number.

112
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,071
Take this third number whatever

113
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,028
that is, multiply it the third number

114
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:12,003
and so on until you get to the end.

115
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,043
And I'm gonna add up the

116
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:16,012
results of these products and the

117
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,041
result of paying that out is going to give us this first element of "Y".

118
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,008
Then when we want to get

119
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:24,037
the second element of "Y", let's say this element.

120
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,051
The way we do that is we

121
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:28,037
take the second row of

122
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:29,093
A and we repeat the whole thing.

123
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:31,007
So we take the second row

124
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,063
of A, and multiply it

125
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:34,012
elements-wise, so the elements

126
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,066
of X and add

127
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:36,066
up the results of the products

128
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,031
and that would give me the

129
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:40,002
second element of Y. And

130
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,045
you keep going to get and we

131
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,067
going to take the third row

132
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:44,031
of A, multiply element Ys

133
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:46,064
with the vector x,

134
00:04:47,056 --> 00:04:48,062
sum up the results and then

135
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,000
I get the third element and so

136
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,019
on, until I get down

137
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:55,037
to the last row like so, okay?

138
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:56,075
So that's the procedure.

139
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,006
Let's do one more example.

140
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:04,024
Here's the example:  So let's look at the dimensions.

141
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,008
Here, this is a three

142
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:09,083
by four dimensional matrix.

143
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,068
This is a four-dimensional vector,

144
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:15,002
or a 4 x 1 matrix, and

145
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:16,063
so the result of this, the

146
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,000
result of this product is going

147
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:19,085
to be a three-dimensional vector.

148
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,000
Write, you know, the vector,

149
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,010
with room for three elements.

150
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:29,020
Let's do the, let's carry out the products.

151
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,073
So for the first element, I'm

152
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:34,016
going to take these four numbers

153
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:36,018
and multiply them with the

154
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:38,055
vector X. So I have

155
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:40,075
1x1, plus 2x3,

156
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:47,035
plus 1x2, plus 5x1, which

157
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,043
is equal to - that's

158
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:54,074
1+6, plus 2+6, which gives me 14.

159
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:57,011
And then for the

160
00:05:58,002 --> 00:05:59,060
second element, I'm going

161
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,093
to take this row now and

162
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:03,085
multiply it with this vector  (0x1)+3.

163
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,055
All right, so

164
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:12,098
0x1+  3x3 plus

165
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,044
0x2 plus 4x1,

166
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,062
which is equal to, let's

167
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:25,072
see that's 9+4, which is 13.

168
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:27,017
And finally, for the last

169
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:28,037
element, I'm going to take

170
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:30,035
this last row, so I

171
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:33,006
have minus one times one.

172
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,075
You have minus two, or really there's a plus next to a two I guess.

173
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,020
Times three plus zero

174
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:41,081
times two plus zero times

175
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,076
one, and so that's

176
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,005
going to be minus one minus

177
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,012
six, which is going to make

178
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,018
this seven, and so that's vector seven.

179
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:49,055
Okay?

180
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,081
So my final answer is this

181
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:53,091
vector fourteen, just to

182
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:55,043
write to that without the colors, fourteen,

183
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,051
thirteen, negative seven.

184
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:03,029
And as promised, the

185
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:06,075
result here is a three by one matrix.

186
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,067
So that's how you multiply a matrix and a vector.

187
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,013
I know that a lot just

188
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,050
happened on this slide, so

189
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:14,056
if you're not quite sure where all

190
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:15,072
these numbers went, you know,

191
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,025
feel free to pause the video

192
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:18,016
you know, and so take a

193
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:19,037
slow careful look at this

194
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:20,098
big calculation that we just

195
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:22,020
did and try to make

196
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,054
sure that you understand the steps

197
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,099
of what just happened to get

198
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:27,097
us these numbers,fourteen, thirteen and eleven.

199
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:31,058
Finally, let me show you a neat trick.

200
00:07:31,094 --> 00:07:33,076
Let's say we have

201
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:35,076
a set of four houses so 4

202
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,025
houses with 4 sizes like these.

203
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:39,039
And let's say I have a

204
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:41,031
hypotheses for predicting what is

205
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,010
the price of a house, and

206
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,002
let's say I want to compute,

207
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:48,026
you know, H of X for each of my 4 houses here.

208
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,047
It turns out there's neat way

209
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:52,081
of posing this, applying this

210
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:55,057
hypothesis to all of my houses at the same time.

211
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,061
It turns out there's a neat

212
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,093
way to pose this as a

213
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,045
Matrix Vector multiplication.

214
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,041
So, here's how I'm going to do it.

215
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:06,024
I am going to construct a matrix as follows.

216
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,082
My matrix is going to be

217
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:11,062
1111 times, and I'm

218
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:15,011
going to write down the sizes

219
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,075
of my four houses here and

220
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:20,068
I'm going to construct a vector

221
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:23,000
as well, And my

222
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:24,083
vector is going to this

223
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:29,020
vector of two elements, that's

224
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:31,049
minus 40 and 0.25.

225
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:33,073
That's these two co-efficients;

226
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:35,034
data 0 and data 1.

227
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,041
And what I am going

228
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,053
to do is to take matrix

229
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,057
and that vector and multiply them

230
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,061
together, that times is that multiplication symbol.

231
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:42,095
So what do I get?

232
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:45,012
Well this is a

233
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,009
four by two matrix.

234
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,041
This is a two by one matrix.

235
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,065
So the outcome is going

236
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:54,094
to be a four by one

237
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,065
vector, all right.

238
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:02,065
So, let me,

239
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,017
so this is

240
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,004
going to be a 4 by

241
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:06,087
1 matrix is the outcome or

242
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,045
really a four diminsonal vector,

243
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,070
so let me write it as

244
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:13,096
one of my four elements in my four real numbers here.

245
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,011
Now it turns out and so

246
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,069
this first element of this

247
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,041
result, the way I

248
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,009
am going to get that is, I

249
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:24,048
am going to take this and multiply it by the vector.

250
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,014
And so this is going to

251
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:32,052
be -40 x

252
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,065
1 + 4.25 x 2104.

253
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:38,088
By the way, on

254
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:40,050
the earlier slides I was

255
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,098
writing 1 x -40 and

256
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:44,001
2104 x 0.25, but

257
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,016
the order doesn't matter, right?

258
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:48,096
-40 x 1 is the same as 1 x -40.

259
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:50,092
And this first element, of course,

260
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,054
is "H" applied to 2104.

261
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,021
So it's really the

262
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,079
predicted price of my first house.

263
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:00,091
Well, how about the second element?

264
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,091
Hope you can see

265
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,064
where I am going to get the second element.

266
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:07,088
Right?

267
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:09,096
I'm gonna take this and multiply it by my vector.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,079
And so that's gonna be

269
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,050
-40 x 1 + 0.25 x 1416.

270
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:20,075
And so this is going be "H" of 1416.

271
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:23,011
Right?

272
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,087
And so on for the

273
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:29,051
third and the fourth

274
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:33,012
elements of this 4 x 1 vector.

275
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,048
And just there, right?

276
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,007
This thing here that I

277
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,029
just drew the green box around,

278
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,046
that's a real number, OK?

279
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,079
That's a single real number,

280
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:45,054
and this thing here that

281
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,032
I drew the magenta box around--the

282
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:48,098
purple, magenta color box

283
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:50,076
around--that's a real number, right?

284
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:52,055
And so this thing on

285
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,095
the right--this thing on the

286
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:55,020
right overall, this is a

287
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,095
4 by 1 dimensional matrix, was a 4 dimensional vector.

288
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,038
And, the neat thing about

289
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:01,099
this is that when you're

290
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,049
actually implementing this in software--so

291
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:06,019
when you have four houses and

292
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:07,053
when you want to use your hypothesis

293
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:11,037
to predict the prices, predict the price "Y" of all of these four houses.

294
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,042
What this means is that, you

295
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,052
know, you can write this in one line of code.

296
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:17,057
When we talk about octave and

297
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,051
program languages later, you can

298
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,091
actually, you'll actually write this in one line of code.

299
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,030
You write prediction equals my,

300
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,082
you know, data matrix times

301
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:33,058
parameters, right?

302
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:36,063
Where data matrix is

303
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:38,002
this thing here, and parameters

304
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:40,016
is this thing here, and this

305
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,062
times is a matrix vector multiplication.

306
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:45,027
And if you just do this then

307
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,040
this variable prediction - sorry

308
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:49,007
for my bad handwriting - then

309
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,067
just implement this one

310
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:52,008
line of code assuming you have

311
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:54,078
an appropriate library to do matrix vector multiplication.

312
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:56,017
If you just do this,

313
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,054
then prediction becomes this

314
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,055
4 by 1 dimensional vector, on

315
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:03,047
the right, that just gives you all the predicted prices.

316
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:06,084
And your alternative to doing

317
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,024
this as a matrix vector multiplication

318
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,080
would be to write eomething like

319
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,027
, you know, for I equals 1 to 4, right?

320
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:14,075
And you have say a thousand houses

321
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:17,001
it would be for I equals 1 to a thousand or whatever.

322
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:18,027
And then you have to write a

323
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:21,038
prediction, you know, if I equals.

324
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,000
and then do a bunch

325
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:25,046
more work over there and it

326
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,008
turns out that When you

327
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:27,098
have a large number of houses,

328
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:29,041
if you're trying to predict the prices

329
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:30,090
of not just four but maybe

330
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,023
of a thousand houses then

331
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,099
it turns out that when

332
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,000
you implement this in the

333
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:39,040
computer, implementing it like this, in any of the various languages.

334
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,035
This is not only true for

335
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,075
Octave, but for Supra Server

336
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:45,096
Java or Python, other high-level, other languages as well.

337
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,065
It turns out, that, by writing

338
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:49,037
code in this style on the

339
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:51,009
left, it allows you to

340
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:53,015
not only simplify the

341
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,039
code, because, now, you're just

342
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,058
writing one line of code

343
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,014
rather than the form of a bunch of things inside.

344
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,064
But, for subtle reasons, that we

345
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:01,028
will see later, it turns

346
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,029
out to be much more computationally

347
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,094
efficient to make predictions

348
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,046
on all of the prices of

349
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,003
all of your houses doing it

350
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:09,057
the way on the left than the

351
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:12,037
way on the right than if you were to write your own formula.

352
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,035
I'll say more about this

353
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:15,044
later when we talk about

354
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,052
vectorization, but, so, by

355
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:18,096
posing a prediction this way, you

356
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,027
get not only a simpler piece

357
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,020
of code, but a more efficient one.

358
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,072
So, that's it for

359
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,094
matrix vector multiplication and we'll

360
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:27,094
make good use of these sorts

361
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,009
of operations as we develop

362
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:31,095
the living regression in other models further.

363
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,009
But, in the next video we're

364
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,095
going to take this and generalize this

365
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:38,045
to the case of matrix matrix multiplication.
