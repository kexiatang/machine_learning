1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,054
In this video, I want to

2
00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:02,070
tell you about a couple of special

3
00:00:02,087 --> 00:00:04,074
matrix operations, called the

4
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:07,042
matrix inverse and the matrix transpose operation.

5
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,082
Let's start by talking about matrix

6
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,082
inverse, and as

7
00:00:12,093 --> 00:00:14,026
usual we'll start by thinking about

8
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,091
how it relates to raw numbers.

9
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:18,048
In the last video, I said

10
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:20,041
that the number one plays the

11
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:24,037
role of the identity in

12
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,069
the space of raw numbers because

13
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:27,082
one times anything is equal to itself.

14
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:29,067
It turns out that raw numbers

15
00:00:30,023 --> 00:00:31,035
have this property that very

16
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,096
number have an, that

17
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:34,004
each number has an inverse,

18
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,015
for example, given the number

19
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,028
three, there exists some

20
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,003
number, which happens to

21
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,039
be three inverse so that

22
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:43,065
that number times gives you

23
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:45,054
back the identity element one.

24
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,045
And so to me, inverse of course this is just one third.

25
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,089
And given some other number,

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,015
maybe twelve there is

27
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:56,082
some number which is the

28
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:58,090
inverse of twelve written as

29
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:01,020
twelve to the minus one, or

30
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:02,072
really this is just one twelve.

31
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,062
So that when you multiply these two things together.

32
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:08,040
the product is equal to

33
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:10,089
the identity element one again.

34
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,070
Now it turns out that in

35
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:16,040
the space of raw numbers, not everything has an inverse.

36
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,040
For example the number zero

37
00:01:19,015 --> 00:01:20,034
does not have an inverse, right?

38
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:24,020
Because zero's a zero inverse, one over zero that's undefined.

39
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:28,040
Like this one over zero is not well defined.

40
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,004
And what we want to

41
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:32,032
do, in the rest of this

42
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,065
slide, is figure out what does

43
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,090
it mean to compute the inverse of a matrix.

44
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,040
Here's the idea: If

45
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:42,089
A is a end by

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,093
end matrix, and it

47
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,031
has an inverse, I will say

48
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,081
a bit more about that later, then

49
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:49,065
the inverse is going to

50
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:51,056
be written A to the

51
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:53,054
minus one and A

52
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:55,065
times this inverse, A to

53
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,082
the minus one, is going to

54
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,098
equal to A inverse times

55
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:00,051
A, is going to

56
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:02,015
give us back the identity matrix.

57
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:03,001
Okay?

58
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:06,095
Only matrices that are

59
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:09,034
m by m for some the idea of M having inverse.

60
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,043
So, a matrix is

61
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,061
M by M, this is also

62
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:15,084
called a square matrix and

63
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:17,072
it's called square because

64
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:23,030
the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.

65
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:26,027
Right and it turns out

66
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:28,078
only square matrices have inverses,

67
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:30,081
so A is a square

68
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:32,005
matrix, is m by m,

69
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:36,046
on inverse this equation over here.

70
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:38,022
Let's look at a concrete example,

71
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:41,053
so let's say I

72
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:44,049
have a matrix, three, four,

73
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:47,008
two, sixteen.

74
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,034
So this is a two by

75
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,068
two matrix, so it's

76
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:52,099
a square matrix and so this

77
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,018
may just could have an and

78
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,061
it turns out that I

79
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:58,096
happen to know the inverse

80
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:00,061
of this matrix is zero point

81
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:02,046
four, minus zero point

82
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,027
one, minus zero point

83
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:07,040
zero five, zero zero seven five.

84
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,059
And if I take this matrix

85
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,015
and multiply these together it

86
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,006
turns out what I get

87
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:15,037
is the two by

88
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:17,077
two identity matrix, I,

89
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:19,084
this is I two by two.

90
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:20,046
Okay?

91
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,019
And so on this slide,

92
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,016
you know this matrix is

93
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,003
the matrix A, and this matrix is the matrix A-inverse.

94
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,036
And it turns out

95
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,065
if that you are computing A

96
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:31,016
times A-inverse, it turns out

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,047
if you compute A-inverse times

98
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:35,038
A you also get back the identity matrix.

99
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,043
So how did I

100
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,075
find this inverse or how

101
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:41,075
did I come up with this inverse over here?

102
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,050
It turns out that sometimes

103
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,030
you can compute inverses by hand

104
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:48,033
but almost no one does that these days.

105
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,075
And it turns out there is

106
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:51,049
very good numerical software for

107
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:55,016
taking a matrix and computing its inverse.

108
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,019
So again, this is one of

109
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,011
those things where there are lots

110
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,025
of open source libraries that

111
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,043
you can link to from any

112
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:04,005
of the popular programming languages to compute inverses of matrices.

113
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,003
Let me show you a quick example.

114
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,034
How I actually computed this inverse,

115
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:11,024
and what I did was I used software called Optive.

116
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:13,075
So let me bring that up.

117
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:16,093
We will see a lot about Optive later.

118
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,018
Let me just quickly show you an example.

119
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,093
Set my matrix A to

120
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:22,012
be equal to that matrix on

121
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,041
the left, type three four

122
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,068
two sixteen, so that's my matrix A right.

123
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,058
This is matrix 34,

124
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:30,091
216 that I have down

125
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,044
here on the left.

126
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:33,081
And, the software lets me compute

127
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,092
the inverse of A very easily.

128
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,031
It's like P over A equals this.

129
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,055
And so, this is right,

130
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,075
this matrix here on my

131
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,032
four minus, on my one, and so on.

132
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,076
This given the numerical

133
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,063
solution to what is the

134
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,014
inverse of A. So let me

135
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:50,019
just write, inverse of A

136
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:52,005
equals P inverse of

137
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:54,054
A over that I

138
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:57,000
can now just verify that A

139
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,012
times A inverse the identity

140
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,029
is, type A times the

141
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:02,018
inverse of A and

142
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,054
the result of that is

143
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,018
this matrix and this is

144
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,037
one one on the diagonal

145
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,032
and essentially ten to

146
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:11,049
the minus seventeen, ten to the

147
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:13,017
minus sixteen, so Up to

148
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,073
numerical precision, up to

149
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:15,075
a little bit of round off

150
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,010
error that my computer

151
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:20,037
had in finding optimal matrices

152
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:22,050
and these numbers off the

153
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:24,004
diagonals are essentially zero

154
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:27,074
so A times the inverse is essentially the identity matrix.

155
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,062
Can also verify the inverse of

156
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,062
A times A is also

157
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:34,061
equal to the identity,

158
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:37,066
ones on the diagonals and values

159
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,062
that are essentially zero except

160
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:40,061
for a little bit of round

161
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,066
dot error on the off diagonals.

162
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:47,008
If a definition that the inverse

163
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:48,018
of a matrix is, I had

164
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,000
this caveat first it must

165
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,008
always be a square matrix, it

166
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,044
had this caveat, that if

167
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:56,075
A has an inverse, exactly what

168
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,026
matrices have an inverse

169
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:59,093
is beyond the scope of this

170
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,081
linear algebra for review that one

171
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:03,025
intuition you might take away

172
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,002
that just as the

173
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,044
number zero doesn't have an

174
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:08,025
inverse, it turns out

175
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:10,005
that if A is say the

176
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,098
matrix of all zeros, then

177
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:14,056
this matrix A also does

178
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,017
not have an inverse because there's

179
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,091
no matrix there's no A

180
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:19,058
inverse matrix so that this

181
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,001
matrix times some other

182
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:22,000
matrix will give you the

183
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:23,063
identity matrix so this matrix of

184
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:25,002
all zeros, and there

185
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,006
are a few other matrices with properties similar to this.

186
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:30,093
That also don't have an inverse.

187
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,019
But it turns out that

188
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:33,039
in this review I don't

189
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,044
want to go too deeply into what

190
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:36,097
it means matrix have an

191
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,055
inverse but it turns

192
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:39,075
out for our machine learning

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,073
application this shouldn't be

194
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:43,025
an issue or more precisely

195
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:46,022
for the learning algorithms where

196
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:47,062
this may be an to namely

197
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:48,099
whether or not an inverse matrix

198
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,082
appears and I will tell when

199
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:51,097
we get to those learning algorithms

200
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,068
just what it means for an

201
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:54,085
algorithm to have or not

202
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,018
have an inverse and how to fix it in case.

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,024
Working with matrices that don't

204
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:01,004
have inverses.

205
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:02,077
But the intuition if you

206
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,006
want is that you can

207
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:05,050
think of matrices as not

208
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:06,075
have an inverse that is somehow

209
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,050
too close to zero in some sense.

210
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,031
So, just to wrap

211
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:14,089
up the terminology, matrix that

212
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,060
don't have an inverse Sometimes called

213
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:18,042
a singular matrix or degenerate

214
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,075
matrix and so this

215
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:22,056
matrix over here is an

216
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:24,006
example zero zero zero matrix.

217
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,066
is an example of a matrix that is singular, or a matrix that is degenerate.

218
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:31,004
Finally, the last special

219
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:32,056
matrix operation I want to

220
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:34,012
tell you about is to do matrix transpose.

221
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:36,019
So suppose I have

222
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,075
matrix A, if I compute

223
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,022
the transpose of A, that's what I get here on the right.

224
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,091
This is a transpose which is

225
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:45,008
written and A superscript T,

226
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,024
and the way you compute

227
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,089
the transpose of a matrix is as follows.

228
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,031
To get a transpose I am going

229
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:51,062
to first take the first

230
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,050
row of A one to zero.

231
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,056
That becomes this first column of this transpose.

232
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,050
And then I'm going to take

233
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:00,064
the second row of A,

234
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:03,061
3 5 9, and that becomes the second column.

235
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,030
of the matrix A transpose.

236
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,089
And another way of

237
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:09,005
thinking about how the computer transposes

238
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,039
is as if you're taking this

239
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:14,004
sort of 45 degree axis

240
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:16,018
and you are mirroring or you

241
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:19,056
are flipping the matrix along that 45 degree axis.

242
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:23,014
so here's the more formal

243
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,082
definition of a matrix transpose.

244
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,037
Let's say A is a m by n matrix.

245
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,045
And let's let B equal A

246
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,053
transpose and so BA transpose like so.

247
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:37,024
Then B is going to

248
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:38,075
be a n by m matrix

249
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,005
with the dimensions reversed so

250
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,097
here we have a 2x3 matrix.

251
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:48,004
And so the transpose becomes a

252
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,075
3x2 matrix, and moreover,

253
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:53,057
the BIJ is equal to AJI.

254
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:56,002
So the IJ element of this

255
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,038
matrix B is going to be

256
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:59,059
the JI element of that

257
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,011
earlier matrix A. So for

258
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:04,014
example, B 1 2

259
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,051
is going to be equal

260
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:08,050
to, look at this

261
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:09,086
matrix, B 1 2 is going to be equal to

262
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,075
this element 3 1st row, 2nd column.

263
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,087
And that equal to this, which

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,083
is a two one, second

265
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:21,014
row first column, right, which

266
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,019
is equal to two and some

267
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:25,025
of the example B 3

268
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:28,033
2, right, that's B

269
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,025
3 2 is this element 9,

270
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:32,022
and that's equal to

271
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,034
a two three which is

272
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,024
this element up here, nine.

273
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:40,011
And so that wraps up

274
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:41,076
the definition of what it

275
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:42,075
means to take the transpose

276
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,075
of a matrix and that

277
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:48,000
in fact concludes our linear algebra review.

278
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,039
So by now hopefully you know

279
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:51,059
how to add and subtract

280
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,047
matrices as well as

281
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:55,011
multiply them and you

282
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:57,000
also know how, what are

283
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:58,045
the definitions of the inverses

284
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:00,037
and transposes of a matrix

285
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,017
and these are the main operations

286
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:04,025
used in linear algebra

287
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:05,087
for this course.

288
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:08,012
In case this is the first time you are seeing this material.

289
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:10,009
I know this was a lot

290
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,053
of linear algebra material all presented

291
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,025
very quickly and it's a

292
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,035
lot to absorb but

293
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,084
if you there's no need

294
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,005
to memorize all the definitions

295
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,058
we just went through and if

296
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:23,022
you download the copy of either

297
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,012
these slides or of the

298
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:27,042
lecture notes from the course website.

299
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,046
and use either the slides or

300
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:30,057
the lecture notes as a reference

301
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,063
then you can always refer back

302
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,007
to the definitions and to figure

303
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,020
out what are these matrix

304
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:38,048
multiplications, transposes and so on definitions.

305
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,022
And the lecture notes on the course website also

306
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,099
has pointers to additional

307
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:44,046
resources linear algebra which

308
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:46,083
you can use to learn more about linear algebra by yourself.

309
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:52,046
And next with these new tools.

310
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,083
We'll be able in the next

311
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,064
few videos to develop more colorful

312
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,045
forms of linear regression that

313
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,070
can view of a lot

314
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:00,063
more data, a lot more

315
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,077
features, a lot more training

316
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:04,009
examples and later on

317
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,075
after the new regression we'll actually

318
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,053
continue using these linear

319
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,037
algebra tools to derive more

320
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,077
powerful learning algorithims as well
