1
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:01,021
In this video we talk about

2
00:00:01,054 --> 00:00:03,029
matrix, matrix multiplication or

3
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:05,040
how to multiply two matrices together.

4
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:07,054
When we talk about the method

5
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:09,015
in linear regression for how

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,022
to solve for the parameters,

7
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:12,077
theta zero and theta one, all in one shot.

8
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:15,097
So, without needing an iterative algorithm like gradient descent.

9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,058
When we talk about that algorithm,

10
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:19,051
it turns out that matrix, matrix

11
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:22,064
multiplication is one of the key steps that you need to know.

12
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,089
So, let's, as usual, start with an example.

13
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:29,082
Let's say I have two matrices

14
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,006
and I want to multiply them together.

15
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:34,021
Let me again just reference this

16
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:36,081
example and then I'll tell you in a little bit what happens.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, the first thing

18
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:40,042
I'm gonna do is, I'm going

19
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:42,039
to pull out the first

20
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:45,035
column of this matrix on the right.

21
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:47,095
And I'm going to take this

22
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:49,003
matrix on the left and

23
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:51,000
multiply it by, you know, a vector.

24
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:54,028
That's just this first column, OK?

25
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,017
And it turns out if I

26
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:58,099
do that I am going to get the vector 11, 9.

27
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,053
So, this is the same matrix

28
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:04,043
vector multiplication as you saw in the last videos.

29
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:08,037
I worked this out in advance so, I know it's 11, 9.

30
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:10,034
And, then, the second thing

31
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:12,057
I'm going to do is, I'm going

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,085
to pull out the second column,

33
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:15,085
this matrix on the right and

34
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:17,046
I am then going to

35
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:20,001
take this matrix on the left,

36
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,009
right, so, it will be that matrix,

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,062
and multiply it by

38
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,060
that second column on the right.

39
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:26,035
So, again, this is a matrix

40
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:28,076
vector multiplication set, which

41
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:30,051
you saw from the previous video, and

42
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:31,050
it turns out that if you

43
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,062
multiply this matrix and this

44
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,025
vector, you get 10,

45
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:36,006
14 and by

46
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:37,018
the way, if you want to practice

47
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:39,053
your matrix vector multiplication, feel

48
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:41,081
free to pause the video and check this product yourself.

49
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:44,014
Then, I'm just going

50
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,062
to take these two results and

51
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:47,089
put them together, and that will be my answer.

52
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,067
So, turns out the

53
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:51,015
outcome of this product is going

54
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,087
to be a 2 by 2 matrix, and

55
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:54,039
The way I am going to fill

56
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:56,014
in this matrix is just by

57
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,076
taking my elements 11,

58
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,085
9 and plugging them here, and

59
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:01,082
taking 10, 14 and plugging

60
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:05,054
them into the second column.

61
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:06,071
Okay?

62
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,066
So, that was the mechanics of

63
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:10,021
how to multiply a matrix by

64
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:11,074
another matrix.

65
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,093
You basically look at the

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,062
second matrix one column at a time, and you assemble the answers.

67
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,003
And again, we will step

68
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,024
through this much more carefully in

69
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:20,059
a second, but I just

70
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,059
want to point out also, this

71
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,087
first example is a 2x3 matrix matrix.

72
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,043
Multiplying that by a

73
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:30,028
3x2 matrix, and the

74
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:32,021
outcome of this product, it

75
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,061
turns out to be a 2x2

76
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:35,087
matrix.

77
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,068
And again, we'll see in a second why this was the case.

78
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:39,099
All right.

79
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,075
That was the mechanics of the calculation.

80
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,053
Let's actually look at the

81
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:44,083
details and look at what

82
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,050
exactly happened.

83
00:02:46,077 --> 00:02:46,078
Here are details.

84
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,024
I have a matrix A and

85
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,011
I want to multiply that

86
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,058
with a matrix B, and the result

87
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,062
will be some new matrix C. And

88
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,086
it turns out you can only

89
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,090
multiply together matrices whose

90
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,056
dimensions match so A

91
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,066
is an m by n matrix,

92
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:04,015
so m columns, n columns and

93
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,024
I am going to multiply

94
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:06,047
that with an n by o

95
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,096
and it turns out this n

96
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,006
here must match this n

97
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,066
here, so the number of columns

98
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:14,066
in first matrix must equal to the number of rows in second matrix.

99
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,081
And the result of this

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,066
product will be an M

101
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:24,044
by O matrix, like the the matrix C here.

102
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,036
And, in the previous

103
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,002
video, everything we did corresponded

104
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:30,018
to this special case of OB

105
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,025
equal to 1.

106
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:32,043
Okay?

107
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,090
That was, that was in case of B being a vector.

108
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:36,025
But now, we are going to

109
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:39,018
view of the case of values of O larger than 1.

110
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:41,040
So, here's how you

111
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,021
multiply together the two matrices.

112
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:46,018
In order to get, what

113
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:47,056
I am going to do is

114
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:49,018
I am going to take the

115
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:50,061
first column of B

116
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,088
and treat that as a vector,

117
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:55,015
and multiply the matrix A,

118
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,034
with the first column of B,

119
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,037
and the result of that will

120
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:00,037
be a M by 1 vector,

121
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,068
and we're going to put that over here.

122
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:06,025
Then, I'm going to

123
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,090
take the second column

124
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,091
of B, right, so,

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,059
this is another n by

126
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:15,006
one vector, so, this column

127
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,049
here, this is right, n

128
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,050
by one, those are n dimensional

129
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:19,051
vector, gonna multiply this

130
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,037
matrix with this n by one vector.

131
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:23,038
The result will be

132
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,011
a M dimensional vector,

133
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:27,002
which we'll put there.

134
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:28,055
And, so on.

135
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:29,001
Okay?

136
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,055
And, so, you know, and then

137
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:31,073
I'm going to take the third

138
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,029
column, multiply it by

139
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:36,023
this matrix, I get a M dimensional vector.

140
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,002
And so on, until you get

141
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,061
to the last column times,

142
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,087
the matrix times the

143
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,042
lost column gives you

144
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:45,007
the lost column of C.

145
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,010
Just to say that again.

146
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,050
The ith column of the

147
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,030
matrix C is attained

148
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:55,097
by taking the matrix A and

149
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:57,041
multiplying the matrix A with

150
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,050
the ith column of the

151
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,017
matrix B for the values

152
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,011
of I equals 1, 2

153
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,088
up through O. Okay ?

154
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,029
So, this is just a summary

155
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:08,037
of what we did up there

156
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,063
in order to compute the matrix

157
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,033
C.  Let's look at just one more example.

158
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:15,064
Let 's say, I want to multiply together these two matrices.

159
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,006
So, what I'm going to

160
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,083
do is, first pull

161
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,051
out the first column

162
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,017
of my second matrix, that

163
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:25,097
was matrix B, that was

164
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:28,000
my matrix B on the previous slide.

165
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,045
And, I therefore, have this

166
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,063
matrix times my vector and

167
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:34,055
so, oh, let's do this calculation quickly.

168
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,018
There's going to be equal to,

169
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:38,091
right, 1, 3 times 0,

170
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,050
3 so that gives 1

171
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:45,032
times 0, plus 3 times 3.

172
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:48,002
And, the second element

173
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,052
is going to be 2,

174
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:50,097
5 times 0, 3 so, that's going to

175
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,056
be two times 0 plus 5

176
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:56,082
times 3 and that is

177
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:01,098
9,15, actually didn't

178
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:03,041
write that in green, so this

179
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:08,075
is nine fifteen, and then mix.

180
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,082
I am going to pull out

181
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:13,081
the second column of this,

182
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:15,042
and do the corresponding

183
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:17,097
calculation so there's this

184
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,019
matrix times this vector 1, 2.

185
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:22,014
Let's also do this

186
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,045
quickly, so that's one times

187
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:27,010
one plus three times two.

188
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:28,064
So that deals with that

189
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:30,073
row, let's do the

190
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,030
other one, so let's see,

191
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:37,011
that gives me two times

192
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:40,007
one plus times two,

193
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,037
so that is going to

194
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:45,073
be equal to, let's see,

195
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,011
one times one plus three times

196
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:50,006
one is four and two

197
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:51,062
times one plus five times two

198
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,019
is twelve.

199
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:56,045
So now I have these two

200
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:58,013
you, and so my

201
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,081
outcome, so the product

202
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,036
of these two matrices is going

203
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:03,039
to be, this goes

204
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:06,097
here and this

205
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,049
goes here, so I

206
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:13,097
get nine fifteen and

207
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,039
four twelve and you

208
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:19,018
may notice also that the result

209
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,097
of multiplying a 2x2 matrix

210
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:22,061
with another 2x2 matrix.

211
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:25,000
The resulting dimension is going

212
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:26,024
to be that first two times

213
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:27,082
that second two, so the result

214
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:31,045
is itself also a two by two matrix.

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,094
Finally let me show you

216
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,057
one more neat trick you can

217
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:39,032
do with matrix matrix multiplication.

218
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:42,026
Let's say as before that we

219
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,010
have four houses whose

220
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,076
prices we want to predict,

221
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,041
only now we have three

222
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,068
competing hypothesis shown here

223
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,095
on the right, so if

224
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,051
you want to So apply all

225
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,052
3 competing hypotheses to

226
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:58,072
all four of the houses, it

227
00:07:58,087 --> 00:07:59,068
turns out you can do that

228
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:01,061
very efficiently using a

229
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:05,007
matrix matrix multiplication so here

230
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,067
on the left is my usual

231
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:08,037
matrix, same as from the

232
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:10,033
last video where these values

233
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,055
are my housing prices and I put ones there on the left as well.

234
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:16,018
And, what I'm going to

235
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:18,025
do is construct another matrix, where

236
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:21,037
here these, the first

237
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,000
column, is this minus

238
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:25,060
40 and two five and

239
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,011
the second column is this two

240
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:29,095
hundred open one and so

241
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:34,016
on and it

242
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,071
turns out that if you

243
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,076
multiply these two matrices

244
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,013
what you find is that, this

245
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:42,038
first column, you know,

246
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:46,034
oh, well how do you get this first column, right?

247
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,045
A procedure from matrix

248
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:50,037
matrix multiplication is the way

249
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:51,075
you get this first column, is

250
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,036
you take this matrix and you

251
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,057
multiply it by this

252
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,057
first column, and we

253
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:58,034
saw in the previous video that this

254
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:00,000
is exactly the predicted

255
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,004
housing prices of the

256
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:05,047
first hypothesis, right?

257
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,015
Of this first hypothesis here.

258
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:10,044
And, how about a second column?

259
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:11,097
Well, how do setup the second column?

260
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,087
The way you get the second column

261
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,040
is, well, you take this

262
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,066
matrix and you multiply by this second column.

263
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,097
And so this second column turns

264
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:24,041
out to be the predictions of

265
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:27,062
the second hypothesis of

266
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,009
the second hypothesis up there,

267
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:33,025
and similarly for the third column.

268
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:35,063
And so, I didn't step

269
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,095
through all the details but hopefully

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,097
you just, feel free to

271
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,011
pause the video and check

272
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:41,053
the math yourself and check

273
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:43,011
that what I just claimed really is true.

274
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,037
But it turns out that by

275
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,029
constructing these two matrices, what

276
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,065
you can therefore do is very

277
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:50,077
quickly apply all three

278
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,034
hypotheses to all four

279
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,007
house sizes to get,

280
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,096
you know, all twelve predicted

281
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,049
prices output by your

282
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,038
three hypotheses on your four houses.

283
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,051
So one matrix multiplications

284
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,040
that you manage to make 12

285
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,092
predictions and, even

286
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:08,020
better, it turns out that

287
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,046
in order to do that matrix

288
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:11,029
multiplication and there are

289
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:12,073
lots of good linear algebra libraries

290
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:14,028
in order to do this

291
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:16,023
multiplication step for you,

292
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,004
and no matter so pretty

293
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:21,040
much any reasonable programming language that you might be using.

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,062
Certainly all the top ten

295
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:26,078
most popular programming languages will have great linear algebra libraries.

296
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,079
And they'll be good thing are

297
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:31,013
highly optimized in order

298
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,083
to do that, matrix matrix

299
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:35,070
multiplication very efficiently, including

300
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,026
taking, taking advantage of

301
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,095
any parallel computation that

302
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:42,024
your computer may be capable

303
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:44,062
of, when your computer has multiple

304
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,003
calls or lots of

305
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,041
multiple processors, within a processor sometimes

306
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,070
there's there's parallelism as well called symdiparallelism [sp].

307
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:54,044
The computer take care of

308
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:56,064
and you should, there are

309
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,017
very good free libraries

310
00:10:58,082 --> 00:10:59,089
that you can use to do

311
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:02,008
this matrix matrix multiplication very

312
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,095
efficiently so that you

313
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,076
can very efficiently, you

314
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,062
know, makes lots of predictions of lots of hypotheses.
