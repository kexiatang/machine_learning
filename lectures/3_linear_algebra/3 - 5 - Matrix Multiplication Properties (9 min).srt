1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,052
matrix multiplication is really

2
00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:02,083
useful since you can pack

3
00:00:03,027 --> 00:00:05,013
a lot of computation into just

4
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,079
one matrix multiplication operation.

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,006
But you should be careful of how you use them.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,098
In this video I want to

7
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:14,041
tell you about a few properties of matrix multiplication.

8
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:19,053
When working with just raw

9
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:20,092
numbers or when working with

10
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:25,012
scalars, multiplication is commutative.

11
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,008
And what I mean by that is

12
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:29,001
if you take three times

13
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:30,055
five, that is equal

14
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,006
to five times three and

15
00:00:32,038 --> 00:00:34,034
the ordering of this multiplication doesn't matter.

16
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:36,084
And this is called the commutative

17
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:41,028
property of multiplication of real numbers.

18
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:43,057
It turns out this property that

19
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,072
you can, you know, reverse

20
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,024
the order in which you

21
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,093
multiply things, this is not true for matrix multiplication.So

22
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:52,014
concretely, if A and

23
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,029
B are matrices, then in

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,092
general, A times B is

25
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,032
not equal to B times

26
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,002
A.  So just be careful of that.

27
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:00,013
It's not okay to arbitrarily reverse

28
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:01,096
the order in which you are multiplying matrices.

29
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:03,082
So, we say that matrix multiplication

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,021
is not commutative, it's a fancy

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,048
way of saying it.

32
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:12,020
As a concrete example, here

33
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,010
are two matrices, matrix 1100

34
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:13,082
times 0020, and if you multiply

35
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:16,010
these two matrices, you get this result on the right.

36
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,089
Now, let's swap around the order of these two matrices.

37
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:21,057
So, I'm going to take these

38
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,048
two matrices and just reverse them.

39
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,007
It turns out if you multiply

40
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,006
these two matrices, you get

41
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,034
the second answer on the

42
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:31,043
right and, you know, real

43
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,039
clearly, these two matrices are

44
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:35,012
not equal to each other.

45
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:37,098
So, in fact, in

46
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,012
general, if you have

47
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:40,079
a matrix operation like

48
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:44,026
A times B. If A

49
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,043
is an m by n matrix

50
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:48,087
and B is an by

51
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,000
M matrix, just as an example.

52
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:53,062
Then, it turns out

53
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:55,075
that the matrix A times

54
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,075
B right, is going

55
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,092
to be an m by

56
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:03,053
m matrix, where as

57
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,020
the matrix b x a

58
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:08,038
is going to be an n

59
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,078
by n matrix so the

60
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,015
dimensions don't even match, right,

61
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,015
so A times B and

62
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:15,037
B times A may not even be the same dimension.

63
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,040
In the example on the left,

64
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:18,047
I have all two by two matrices,

65
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:19,087
so the dimensions were the same,

66
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,034
but in general reversing the

67
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:24,009
order of the matrices

68
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:26,027
can even change the dimension

69
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,022
of the outcome so

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,065
matrix multiplication is not commutative.

71
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:35,063
Here's the next I want to talk about.

72
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,053
So, when talking about real

73
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,050
numbers, or scalars, let's

74
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:42,028
see, I have 3 times 5 times 2.

75
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:45,013
I can either multiply 5

76
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,043
times 2 first, and

77
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:49,084
I can compute this as 3 times 10.

78
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:51,049
Or, I can multiply

79
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:54,041
three times five for us and

80
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:55,065
I can compute this as, you

81
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:57,086
know fifteen times two and

82
00:02:58,002 --> 00:02:59,050
both of these give you the same answer, right?

83
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:00,072
Each, both of these is equal

84
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:03,071
to thirty so Whether I

85
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,011
multiply five times

86
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,096
two first or whether I

87
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:09,050
multiply three times five

88
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:12,034
first because well, three

89
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:13,087
times five times two

90
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:16,002
is equal to three times

91
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:17,093
five times two.

92
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:20,003
And this is called the

93
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:25,075
associative property of role number multiplication.

94
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,047
It turns out that matrix multiplication is associative.

95
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,015
So concretely, let's say

96
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,018
I have a product of three

97
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,046
matrices, A times B times

98
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:36,002
C. Then I can

99
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,068
compute this either as A

100
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:40,071
times, B times C

101
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,053
or I can compute this as

102
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:45,031
A times B, times C

103
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:47,053
and these will actually give me the same answer.

104
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,011
I'm not going to prove this, but

105
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:51,031
you can just take my word for it, I guess.

106
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:52,040
So just be clear what I mean by

107
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,013
these two cases, let's look

108
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,093
at first one first case.

109
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,012
What I mean by that is

110
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,021
if you actually want to compute

111
00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,074
A times B times C, what

112
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,081
you can do is you can

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,077
first compute B times C.

114
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,009
So that D equals B time

115
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,050
C, then compute A times

116
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,084
D.  And so this is really

117
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,038
computing a times B

118
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:12,015
times C.  Or, for

119
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,071
this second case, You can

120
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,084
compute this as, you can

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,055
set E equals A

122
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:19,005
times B.  Then compute E

123
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,055
times C.  And this

124
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,042
is then the same as a

125
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,087
times B times C

126
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:27,006
and it turns out that both

127
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:29,089
of these options will give

128
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,043
you, is guaranteed to give you the same answer.

129
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,073
And so we say that matrix

130
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:38,043
multiplication does enjoy the associative property.

131
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:40,076
Okay?

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,025
And don't worry about the terminology

133
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:45,006
associative and commutative that's

134
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:46,008
why there's not really going to use

135
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:46,093
this terminology later in these

136
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,010
class, so don't worry about memorizing those terms.

137
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:52,061
Finally, I want to

138
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,088
tell you about the identity

139
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:55,043
matrix, which is special matrix.

140
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,091
So let's again make the

141
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,005
analogy to what we know

142
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,005
of raw numbers, so when dealing

143
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,035
with raw numbers or scalar

144
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,010
numbers, the number one,

145
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,089
is you can think

146
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:08,050
of it as the identity of multiplication,

147
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:10,052
and what I mean by that

148
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:12,026
is for any number

149
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:14,085
Z, the number 1

150
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:16,048
times z is equal

151
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:19,060
to z times one, and

152
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:21,035
that's just equal to

153
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,024
the number z, right, for any raw number.

154
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,001
Z. So 1 is

155
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,086
the identity operation and so it satisfies this equation.

156
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,017
So it turns out that

157
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,081
in the space of matrices as

158
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:35,012
an identity matrix as well.

159
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,099
And it's unusually denoted i,

160
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,044
or sometimes we write it

161
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:40,052
as i of n by

162
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:42,031
n we want to make explicit the dimensions.

163
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,013
So I subscript n by n

164
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:46,058
is the n by n identity matrix.

165
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,076
And so there's a different identity

166
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:52,036
matrix for each dimension n and are a few examples.

167
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,044
Here's the two by two identity

168
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:56,017
matrix, here's the three

169
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,079
by three identity matrix, here's the four by four identity matrix.

170
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:01,075
So the identity matrix, has the

171
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:03,013
property that it has

172
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:04,061
ones along the diagonals,

173
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,093
right, and so on and

174
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:12,069
is zero everywhere else, and

175
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,092
so, by the way the

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,004
one by one identity matrix is just a number one.

177
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:18,013
This is one by one matrix

178
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:19,088
just and it's not a very

179
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,094
interesting identity matrix and informally

180
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:24,026
when I or others are being

181
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:26,030
sloppy, very often, we will

182
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,017
write the identity matrix using fine notation.

183
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,022
I draw, you know, let's

184
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:31,049
go back to it and just write 1111,

185
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,018
dot, dot, dot, 1

186
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,058
and then we'll, maybe, somewhat

187
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,085
sloppily write a bunch of zeros there.

188
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,075
And these zeros, this

189
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:41,072
big zero, this big zero

190
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:44,000
that's meant to denote that this

191
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:46,001
matrix is zero everywhere except for

192
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,008
the diagonals, so this is just

193
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,087
how I might sloppily write

194
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:53,019
this identity matrix

195
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:55,000
She says property that for

196
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:57,017
any matrix A, A times

197
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:58,081
identity i times A

198
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,062
A. So that's a lot

199
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:03,027
like this equation that we have up here.

200
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,024
One times z equals z times

201
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:07,075
one, equals z itself so

202
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,087
I times A equals A

203
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:12,031
times I equals A.  Just

204
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,091
make sure we have the dimensions right, so

205
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,049
if A is a n

206
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,064
by n matrix, then this

207
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,066
identity matrix that's an

208
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:21,051
m by n identity matrix.

209
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,025
And if A is m by

210
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,081
n then this identity

211
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:27,092
matrix, right, for matrix

212
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,006
multiplication make sense that has a

213
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,050
m by n matrix because

214
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,008
this m has a match

215
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,061
up that m And

216
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:38,005
in either case the outcome

217
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,094
of this process is you

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,083
get back to Matrix A, which

219
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,067
is m by n.

220
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:45,075
So whenever we write

221
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,058
the identity matrix I, you

222
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,008
know, very often the dimension rightwill

223
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,075
be implicit from the context.

224
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,048
So these two I's they' re

225
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:55,045
actually different dimension matrices, one

226
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,062
may be N by N, the other

227
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:58,080
is M by M But when

228
00:07:58,095 --> 00:07:59,092
we want to make the dimension

229
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,039
of the matrix explicit, then sometimes

230
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,095
we'll write to this I subscript

231
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:06,026
N by N, kind of like we have up here.

232
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,010
But very often the dimension will be implicit.

233
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:11,018
Finally, just want to point

234
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:14,036
out that earlier I

235
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:16,012
said that A times B

236
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:18,069
is not in general equal

237
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,098
to B times A, right?

238
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:25,000
That for most matrices A and B, this is not true.

239
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:28,064
But when B is the identity matrix, this does hold true.

240
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,063
That A times the identity

241
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:32,099
matrix does indeed equal to

242
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,039
identity times A, it's

243
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:35,051
just that this is not true

244
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,076
for other matrices, B in general.

245
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,025
So that's it for the

246
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,003
properties of matrix multiplication.

247
00:08:43,097 --> 00:08:45,016
And the special matrices, like the

248
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:46,050
identity matrix I want to

249
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:48,012
tell you about, in the next

250
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,088
and final video now linear algebra review.

251
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:53,005
I am going to quickly tell you

252
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:55,030
about a couple of special

253
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,078
matrix operations, and after

254
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,019
that you know everything you need

255
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:01,083
to know about linear algebra for this course
