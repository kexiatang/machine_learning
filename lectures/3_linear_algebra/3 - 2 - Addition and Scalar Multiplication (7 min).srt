1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,032
In this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:02,079
matrix addition and subtraction,

3
00:00:03,098 --> 00:00:04,096
as well as how to

4
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:06,051
multiply a matrix by a

5
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:08,058
number, also called Scalar Multiplication.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,010
Let's start an example.

7
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:14,010
Given two matrices like these,

8
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:16,014
let's say I want to add them together.

9
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:17,030
How do I do that?

10
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:19,003
And so, what does addition of matrices mean?

11
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:21,053
It turns out that if you

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,001
want to add two matrices, what

13
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:25,046
you do is you just add

14
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:27,092
up the elements of these matrices one at a time.

15
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:30,003
So, my result of adding

16
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:31,028
two matrices is going to

17
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:33,046
be itself another matrix and

18
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,097
the first element again just by

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,046
taking one and four and

20
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,089
multiplying them and adding them together, so I get five.

21
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:41,024
The second element I get

22
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,082
by taking two and two

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and adding them, so I get

24
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:47,024
four; three plus three

25
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,025
plus zero is three, and so on.

26
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:50,075
I'm going to stop changing colors, I guess.

27
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,046
And, on the right is open

28
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:54,082
five, ten and two.

29
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,096
And it turns out you can

30
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:59,078
add only two matrices that are of the same dimensions.

31
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,042
So this example is

32
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:04,081
a three by two matrix,

33
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:08,065
because this has 3

34
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,043
rows and 2 columns, so it's 3 by 2.

35
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:13,021
This is also a 3

36
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,098
by 2 matrix, and the

37
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,021
result of adding these two

38
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:18,059
matrices is a 3 by 2 matrix again.

39
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,032
So you can only add

40
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,056
matrices of the same

41
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,001
dimension, and the result

42
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:24,079
will be another matrix that's of

43
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:27,037
the same dimension as the ones you just added.

44
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:30,059
Where as in contrast, if you

45
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:31,060
were to take these two matrices, so this

46
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,073
one is a 3 by

47
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:35,029
2 matrix, okay, 3 rows, 2 columns.

48
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:38,009
This here is a 2 by 2 matrix.

49
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:40,039
And because these two matrices

50
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,015
are not of the same dimension,

51
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,025
you know, this is an error,

52
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:46,040
so you cannot add these

53
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:48,020
two matrices and, you know,

54
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,082
their sum is not well-defined.

55
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:55,065
So that's matrix addition.

56
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:57,071
Next, let's talk about multiplying matrices by a scalar number.

57
00:01:58,037 --> 00:01:59,090
And the scalar is just a,

58
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:01,051
maybe a overly fancy term for,

59
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,048
you know, a number or a real number.

60
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:06,026
Alright, this means real number.

61
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,068
So let's take the number 3 and multiply it by this matrix.

62
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,052
And if you do that, the result is pretty much what you'll expect.

63
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:14,028
You just take your elements

64
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,062
of the matrix and multiply

65
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:17,075
them by 3, one at a time.

66
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,009
So, you know, one

67
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,005
times three is three.

68
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,037
What, two times three is

69
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:25,005
six, 3 times 3

70
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,044
is 9, and let's see, I'm

71
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:29,049
going to stop changing colors again.

72
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,030
Zero times 3 is zero.

73
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:34,043
Three times 5 is 15, and 3 times 1 is three.

74
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,068
And so this matrix is the

75
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:40,021
result of multiplying that matrix on the left by 3.

76
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,084
And you notice, again,

77
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,012
this is a 3 by 2

78
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:44,058
matrix and the result is

79
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:46,088
a matrix of the same dimension.

80
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,047
This is a 3 by

81
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:49,071
2, both of these are

82
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,072
3 by 2 dimensional matrices.

83
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,018
And by the way,

84
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:56,065
you can write multiplication, you know, either way.

85
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:58,065
So, I have three times this matrix.

86
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,015
I could also have written this

87
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,040
matrix and 0, 2, 5, 3, 1, right.

88
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:07,040
I just copied this matrix over to the right.

89
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:10,052
I can also take this matrix and multiply this by three.

90
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:12,003
So whether it's you know, 3

91
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,025
times the matrix or the

92
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:14,086
matrix times three is

93
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:17,093
the same thing and this thing here in the middle is the result.

94
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:22,009
You can also take a matrix and divide it by a number.

95
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:24,009
So, turns out taking

96
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,046
this matrix and dividing it by

97
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,013
four, this is actually the

98
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,063
same as taking the number

99
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:32,019
one quarter, and multiplying it by this matrix.

100
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,078
4, 0, 6, 3 and

101
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:36,068
so, you can figure

102
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,046
the answer, the result of

103
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:39,094
this product is, one quarter

104
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:42,052
times four is one, one quarter times zero is zero.

105
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:45,037
One quarter times six is,

106
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,022
what, three halves, about six over

107
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,019
four is three halves, and

108
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:52,077
one quarter times three is three quarters.

109
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,068
And so that's the results

110
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,072
of computing this matrix divided by four.

111
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,040
Vectors give you the result.

112
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:03,038
Finally, for a slightly

113
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,056
more complicated example, you can

114
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:08,046
also take these operations and combine them together.

115
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:11,034
So in this calculation, I

116
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,056
have three times a vector

117
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:15,037
plus a vector minus another vector divided by three.

118
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:17,099
So just make sure we know where these are, right.

119
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,013
This multiplication.

120
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,031
This is an example of

121
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:27,013
scalar multiplication because I am taking three and multiplying it.

122
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,024
And this is, you know, another

123
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:31,018
scalar multiplication.

124
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,068
Or more like scalar division, I guess.

125
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:35,057
It really just means one zero times this.

126
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,062
And so if we evaluate

127
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:43,005
these two operations first, then

128
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,035
what we get is this thing

129
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:46,085
is equal to, let's see,

130
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:49,004
so three times that vector is three,

131
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,048
twelve, six, plus

132
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,057
my vector in the middle which

133
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:57,049
is a 005 minus

134
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:03,041
one, zero, two-thirds, right?

135
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:05,020
And again, just to make

136
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:06,011
sure we understand what is going on here,

137
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:10,055
this plus symbol, that is

138
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:14,088
matrix addition, right?

139
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:16,085
I really, since these are

140
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:19,085
vectors, remember, vectors are special cases of matrices, right?

141
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,023
This, you can also call

142
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,086
this vector addition This

143
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:26,081
minus sign here, this is

144
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:28,093
again a matrix subtraction,

145
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:32,007
but because this is an

146
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,013
n by 1, really a three

147
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,026
by one matrix, that this

148
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,033
is actually a vector, so this is

149
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:39,032
also vector, this column.

150
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:42,039
We call this matrix a vector subtraction, as well.

151
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:43,045
OK?

152
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:45,035
And finally to wrap this up.

153
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,037
This therefore gives me a

154
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:49,066
vector, whose first element is

155
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,097
going to be 3+0-1,

156
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,075
so that's 3-1, which is 2.

157
00:05:55,094 --> 00:06:00,025
The second element is 12+0-0, which is 12.

158
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:03,037
And the third element

159
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,016
of this is, what, 6+5-(2/3),

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,074
which is 11-(2/3), so

161
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,043
that's 10 and one-third

162
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:15,045
and see, you close this square bracket.

163
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,086
And so this gives me a

164
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:21,043
3 by 1 matrix, which is

165
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,026
also just called a 3

166
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:28,081
dimensional vector, which

167
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,080
is the outcome of this calculation over here.

168
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,062
So that's how you

169
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:36,056
add and subtract matrices and

170
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:39,055
vectors and multiply them by scalars or by row numbers.

171
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,049
So far I have only talked

172
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,041
about how to multiply matrices and

173
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:46,004
vectors by scalars, by row numbers.

174
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:47,099
In the next video we will

175
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,011
talk about a much more

176
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,064
interesting step, of taking

177
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:53,001
2 matrices and multiplying 2 matrices together.
