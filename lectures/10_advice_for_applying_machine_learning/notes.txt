error rate too high on new data? 
- try more training example
- try smaller sets of features to prevent overfitting
- try more features (also equally possible) if feature is not enough
- try adding polynomial features
- try decrease/increase lambda

ML diagnostic find out which to persue

------------------------------------

evaluating hypothesis
split in random order
70% training
30% test set

compare J(theta) traning and J(theta) testing

0/1 misclassification error method as an alternative.
