clustering application:
-------------------------
market segmentation
social networking
organize computing clusters
astronomical data analysis


algorithm:
---------------------
input: K and x(i)
repleat{
  cluster assignment (assign to centroid)
  move centroid(recalculate)
}

if a centroid is assigned 0 point, then:
eliminate that centroid
or
randomly re-initialize that centroid. if K centroid is necessary.


cost function
-----------------
minimize average distance.
also called distortion 

the repeating iteration is actually minizing the cost function by 2 steps
compared to gradient descent, this is easier particularly applied to k-means.
(k-means distortion is not convex)

the cost should be strictly decreasing, otherwise there's a bug



random initialization (avoid local minimum)
--------------------------
K<M
randoming assign mu to k x(i)
run multiple times.when K is relatively small


choose K
------------------------
first consider requirement.(how many segment we need?)
choose by hand. because even an expert can not visualize how many K is suitable sometimes, how can a machine know it?

or

elbow method (worth to try, but not always found one)
