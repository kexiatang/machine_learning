when feature n is large, regression method tends to be computationally difficult. (in computer vision, RGB for each pixel is a feature. for n feature, there's O(n2) quadratic terms if we use feature mapping to polynomial regression)

so we use neural network.

bias unit

notice that bias unit doesn't contribute to the next layer's bias unit. all layer's bias unit is origin. not an outcome of the former layer linear transformation.

"forward propagation"


neural network is a generalization of logistic regression

feedforward propagation


a good reason that neural network ca deal with a lot of features such as pixels is because it doesn't need feature mapping (polynomial terms), the non-linear part is accomplished via layers.
