feedforward propagation is the calculation process
back propagation is the algorithm to get partial derivatives


2 ways good for debuggin:
1.plot J(theta) as function of theta to view the curve decreasing
2.gradient checking



a * delta is only the gadient for one record. for m recourd, we need to accumulate delta (to get Delta) and dived by m 

delta is actually the partial derivative of cost(i) on z where i is the record number. while z'(x) is a, so J'(theta) is a * delta in case of only one record.
