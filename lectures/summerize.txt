supervised learning:
-----------------------
1.regression 
	linear regression
	polynomial regression(can be plug into linear regression)
2.classification
	kNN
	decision tree
	logistic
	one-vs-all logistic
	neural network


algorithm: gradient descent or advanced optimizations


unsupervised learning
-----------------------
1.clustering
	k-means (image compression, market segmentation, social networking, computer clustering, 		astronmical analysis)
2.dimensionality reduction
	PCA
		-data compression(easy store, fast speed)
		-visualization(k=1,2,3)




extra
-------
abnomaly detection / density detection (use instead of supervised learning when postive example is rare and/or unpredictable)
recommender systems/ similarity checking






feature normalizations apply to:
- linear regression, polynomial regression (to accelerate gradient speed)
- SVM with Gaussian kernal (to prevent one feature from dominating the result)
- PCA (to make 0 mean)
- recommender systems(only do mean normalization, no scalling)
