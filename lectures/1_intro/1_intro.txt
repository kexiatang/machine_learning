supervised learning(with training data set): classification(discrete target value), regression(continues target value)
unsupervised learning(without training data set): clustering

different algorithm lead to different result, so choosing the right algorithm is important.


training set -> algorithm -> hypothesis (function)

definition task T, experience E, performance P
